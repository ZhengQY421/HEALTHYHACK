# Patient Portal 
This a project designed with the intention of minimizing the communication gap between hospitalized pateient's family and the hospital. 

A hospitalized patient's family members are constantly worrying about the patient, and as a result, they will constantly call the hospital for information. However, on the hospital's end, nurses often do not have enough time to answer such questions in detail. Pateint Portal attemtps to solve this issue by providing a real time update of the hospitalized patient status with information such as vital status, doctor visits, medicine administered, etc. 

# Project Detail 
A set of example data was obtained for this project. The data contains Patient ID and related information. The data is then inputted into MATLAB to be converted into Jason to be used for Firebase. 

Patient Portal is coded in HTML and Javascript, which connects to the database on Firebase. A user can use the provided Patient ID and password by the hospital to login. 

For demo purpose, please use the following credentials: 

<b>Patient ID: </b> P016A590ED0934667A5DAD68EA6987D93

<b>Password: </b> oxEZw9qM

After logging in, the top panel displays the identification information of the patient, while the botton panel displays the visits. Users can use the drop down menu to navigate through all the past visits. And if they have any question about the visits, they can use the links embedded in the buttons below to search for more details.

# Future  Agenda
Given opportunity to develop this project futher, we intend on implementing connections to vital devices to reflect vital information, messaging function with hospital staff, etc. This project has many possibilities and this is only simple reflection of our idea.
